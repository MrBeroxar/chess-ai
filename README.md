# Chess AI

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need `pyhton3` and `git`. I would recommend `pyhton3.10` but others should work too.

The following instructions are for linux. If you don't know how to apply
them for other OS (i.e. windows or mac), consider proompting Chat Gippity to translate them to your OS.

```
git clone https://github.com/PraxTube/chess-ai.git
cd chess-ai
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Finally you can run the python script
python main.py
```

### Contributing

In order to contribute to this repo, you will need to set up and SSH key for you github account.
You can follow these steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
Note that you will want to change your `git remote origin` in your `chess-ai` folder.
If you don't know how to do this, then you can simply run `git clone git@github.com:PraxTube/chess-ai.git` and then follow the steps above to set it up.

## Milestone I - Dummy AI

The deadline for this is either **11.5** or **18.5**.
